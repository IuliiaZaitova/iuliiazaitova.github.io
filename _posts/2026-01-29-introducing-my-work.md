I’m Iuliia Zaitova, an AI Research Scientist focused on foundation models and multilingual NLP. I’m completing a PhD in Computational Linguistics at Saarland University, Germany (finishing early 2026) and previously interned as an Applied Scientist at Amazon (Alexa TTS, Cambridge, United Kingdom). My work centers on multilingual foundation models for language and speech, with an emphasis on evaluation and robustness.

### What I work on
- Multilingual and cross-lingual evaluation for LLMs and speech-to-text systems.
- Analysis of transformer representations and idiomaticity across languages.
- Scalable training and deployment with PyTorch, distributed setups, and AWS (SageMaker/EC2/S3).

### Recent highlight
At Amazon Alexa TTS, I built and evaluated transformer-based speech and language models (10B+ parameters), plus multilingual evaluation pipelines to assess fairness and robustness.

### What I’m looking for
I’m open to Applied Scientist / Research Scientist roles focused on multilingual NLP, speech, and foundation models. If this aligns with your team, let’s connect: iuliiazaitova@gmail.com.

More details are in my CV and publications pages.
