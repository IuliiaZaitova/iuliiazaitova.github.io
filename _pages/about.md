Hi, I am Iuliia (you-lee-yah), a PhD student at the [Department of Language Science and Technology](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html) at Saarland University. I work on project [C4](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/projects/mutual-intelligibility-and-surprisal-in-slavic-intercomprehension-incomslav/) which is a part of [SFB 1102 - Information Density and Linguistic Encoding](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de).
