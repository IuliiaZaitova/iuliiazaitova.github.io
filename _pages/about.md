Hi, I am Iuliia, a PhD student at the [Department of Language Science and Technology](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/department/lst.html) at Saarland University. I work on project [C4](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/projects/mutual-intelligibility-and-surprisal-in-slavic-intercomprehension-incomslav/) which is a part of [SFB 1102 - Information Density and Linguistic Encoding](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de).

I am mainly interested in Cross-lingual NLP tasks, Multilinguality, Language Modeling, and Machine Learning.

My work and research
======
Currently I am focused on constructional similarity, cross-lingual transparency of multi-component units, and prosody in related languages.

I am open to collaboration, so feel free to send me an e-mail if you have an idea for a project or Master's / Bachelor's thesis.

My background
======
I received my M.Sc. in Language Science and Technology at Saarland University, and my B.A. in Linguistics and Translation Studies at Udmurt State University.
