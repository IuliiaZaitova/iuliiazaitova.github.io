## Summary

AI Research Scientist focused on foundation models & transformers for language and speech (LLMs, ASR, TTS). I’m completing a PhD in Computational Linguistics (Saarland University, Germany) and have industry experience as an Applied Scientist intern at Amazon (Alexa TTS, Cambridge, United Kingdom).

**Current:** foundation models & transformers for language and speech (LLMs, ASR, TTS)

## Core expertise

- **Production ML systems:** large-scale LLMs, ASR, TTS (worked with 10B+ parameter models)
- **Evaluation & quality:** built frameworks for regression detection and cross-lingual model comparison
- **Infrastructure:** PyTorch, AWS (SageMaker, EC2), distributed training pipelines

## Industry experience

**Applied Scientist Intern — Amazon (Alexa TTS, Cambridge, United Kingdom)**

- Built and maintained multilingual evaluation workflows to compare models across languages and conditions
- Investigated regression risks and model failure modes to inform deployment decisions
- Developed scalable preprocessing and evaluation pipelines on AWS (SageMaker, EC2, S3)
- Collaborated with applied scientists, engineers, and PMs on production voice systems

## Research

- 11 peer-reviewed publications at top ML venues (ACL, NAACL, Interspeech). Research directly applicable to production multimodal AI systems, with focus on model robustness and cross-lingual capabilities.

## Currently

- Completing my PhD (early 2026)
- Exploring Applied Scientist / Research Scientist roles in multilingual NLP, speech, and foundation models
